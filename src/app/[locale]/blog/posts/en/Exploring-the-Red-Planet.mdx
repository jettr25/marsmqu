The Mars Rover program has captured the imagination of people worldwide, representing humanity's relentless quest to explore the unknown. Beginning with Sojourner in 1997, each rover has pushed the boundaries of what we know about Mars.

The twin rovers Spirit and Opportunity, which landed in 2004, amazed us with their longevity, far surpassing their planned 90-day missions. Opportunity, for example, operated for nearly 15 years, uncovering evidence of ancient water flows on the Martian surface. Curiosity, which landed in 2012, took things a step further by analyzing the planet's geology and climate, searching for signs that Mars could have supported life.

And then came Perseverance in 2021, equipped with advanced tools for collecting rock samples that may one day return to Earth. Its Ingenuity helicopter companion also made history as the first powered flight on another planet.

These rovers not only uncover secrets about Mars but also lay the groundwork for future human exploration. Their achievements are a testament to the power of innovation, teamwork, and a vision that goes beyond Earth’s boundaries.
