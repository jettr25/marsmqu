Every great journey begins with a single step, and for Team MARS, that step is the launch of our university society and our ambitious mission: to design and build a Mars-inspired rover for next year’s international robotics competition. With a team of over 30 passionate students from diverse disciplines, we’re combining creativity, collaboration, and cutting-edge technology to make this dream a reality.

The idea for Team MARS started as a conversation among a few space enthusiasts. We quickly realised that this was an opportunity to do something extraordinary—not just to showcase our technical skills but also to unite like-minded individuals in the pursuit of a common goal. And so, Team MARS was born, named not only for our planetary inspiration but also for our core values: Mission, Ambition, Resilience, and Synergy.

Starting from scratch has been as challenging as it is exciting. In our first few weeks, we’ve worked to lay the foundation for success by forming sub-teams focused on specific areas like mechanical design, electronics, software, and project management. Each team member brings something unique to the table, whether it’s expertise in coding, experience with hardware, or a knack for keeping everything on track.

Fundraising and sponsorship have been key priorities for us as well. To turn our vision into reality, we’ve begun reaching out to local businesses, alumni, and community supporters. Whether it’s through bake sales, social media campaigns, or grant applications, the entire team is pulling together to secure the resources we need to bring our rover to life.

We’re still in the early stages of planning and prototyping, but the energy and excitement within the team are already incredible. Brainstorming sessions buzz with ideas for the rover’s design, capabilities, and competition strategy. We’re dreaming big while staying grounded in the practical realities of timelines and budgets.

As we move forward, we’re not just building a rover—we’re building a community of innovators, problem-solvers, and friends. The competition is a year away, but every step we take now is a step closer to representing our university on the global stage.
